	<h1>Biography</h1>
	<p>My name is Ron Burgundy, and I have been the lead anchorman for the Channel 4 News Team for most of my life. With my collegues Brick Tamland, Brian Fantana, and Champion 'Champ' Kind, we have been the number one news station in the San Diego area. My closest friend is my dog, Baxter. I am famous for my ability to play the jazz flute, and I perform at a local jazz club when I find time, or when I need to impress a lady. My apartment in the suburbs of San Diego has many leatherbound books and it smells of rich mahogany.</p>
